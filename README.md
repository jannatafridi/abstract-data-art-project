# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oh7pk05XvhD4noaJoeZmJJvKQjdJStWb8uS9QJbcR4E/edit?usp=sharing
- **Breed** (String) - types of cat breeds
- **Minimum Lifespan** (int) - minimum lifespan of specific cat breed
- **Maximum Lifespan** (int) - maximum lifespan of specific cat breed

## Description

My project displays visual data on cat breeds and their lifespans in the theater. It uses datasets with information about cat breeds, minimum lifespans, and maximum lifespans to create Cat objects. Then, it randomly picks a cat and shows its breed, a calculated lifespan, and an image in the theater. In addition, it plays a sound effect of a cat meowing. I used concepts like instance variables, accessor methods, and randomization to make the program work. The user doesn’t have to input anything, they just watch as the program displays the cool visual.
